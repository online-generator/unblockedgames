# DMCA Policy ⚔️

Hey! Welcome to our **DMCA Policy** page. 🌟 If you see something on our site that belongs to you and you didn’t give permission to use it, don’t worry! We’ve got a process to handle it. Here’s how it works:

## 1. What’s the DMCA? 📜

The **DMCA** (that’s the **Digital Millennium Copyright Act**) is a fancy law that helps protect people’s creative stuff. Like, if someone uses your work without asking, this law helps get it sorted out! 🖼️🎶

## 2. What You Can Do 🤔

If you find your game, image, or anything that belongs to you on our site, and you didn’t say it was okay, you can tell us! Just send us a message, and we’ll look into it.

Here’s what we need from you:

- **Your name** (yep, we need to know who you are! 😊)
- **Details of what’s yours** (tell us what content is yours and where it is on our site 🧐)
- **Proof it’s yours** (like a link to where you originally posted it or any other proof 📂)
- **A statement** saying that you didn’t give permission for it to be used here 🙅

## 3. How to Reach Us 📧

Just email us at **[boyknown@gmail.com](mailto:boyknown@gmail.com)**, and we’ll check it out. We promise to take it seriously! 🕵️

## 4. What Happens Next? ⏭️

Once we get your message, we’ll:

- Review your claim to make sure everything’s in order ✅
- Take down the content if needed 🗑️
- Let the person who posted it know what's going on 🔔

## 5. Important! ⚠️

Only send a DMCA request if you *really* believe someone used your stuff without asking. Don’t try to take down things that don’t belong to you — that’s against the rules and could get you in trouble! 😬

That's all about DMCA! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! 😊👋
