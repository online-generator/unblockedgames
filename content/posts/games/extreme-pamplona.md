Okay, so you've probably heard of the Running of the Bulls, right?  It's that crazy event in Pamplona, Spain, where people run with real, live bulls.  It sounds terrifying, but um, people seem to love it!  It's a huge tradition, and a lot of people actually participate.  

But let's be honest, who wants to risk getting trampled by a bull?  😬  I mean, it's a real risk, you know?  And honestly,  it's just a bit too much for me.
